// Alice and Bob have candy bars of different sizes: A[i] is the size of the i-th bar of candy that Alice has, 
// and B[j] is the size of the j-th bar of candy that Bob has.
// Since they are friends, they would like to exchange one candy bar each so that after the exchange, 
// they both have the same total amount of candy.  (The total amount of candy a person has is the sum of the sizes of candy bars they have.)
// Return an integer array ans where ans[0] is the size of the candy bar that Alice must exchange, 
// and ans[1] is the size of the candy bar that Bob must exchange.
// If there are multiple answers, you may return any one of them.  
// It is guaranteed an answer exists.


// Example 1:
// Input: A = [1,1], B = [2,2]
// Output: [1,2]

// Example 2:
// Input: A = [1,2], B = [2,3]
// Output: [1,2]

// Example 3:
// Input: A = [2], B = [1,3]
// Output: [2,3]

// Example 4:
// Input: A = [1,2,5], B = [2,4]
// Output: [5,4]
 

// Note:
// 1 <= A.length <= 10000
// 1 <= B.length <= 10000
// 1 <= A[i] <= 100000
// 1 <= B[i] <= 100000
// It is guaranteed that Alice and Bob have different total amounts of candy.
// It is guaranteed there exists an answer.
